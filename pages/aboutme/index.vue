    <h1>I am a page with Nuxt.js</h1>
    <p>Now you are on /pages/aboutme/index.vue</p>
    <p>
      I use many features of Nuxt.js.<br>
      You can see it!

    <h2>Transition</h2>
    <p>
      You might find that page transition has some opacity.<br>
      You can locate #.css on /assets path and register it in nuxt.config.js to decorate pages.
